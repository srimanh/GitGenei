## 🎯 Problem

Last-minute code submissions are a nightmare 😨 — messy repos, broken branches, lost files, and git conflicts. Hackathon teams lose valuable points to chaos, not code!

---

## 💡 Solution

**Upload your entire project** — Our platform:
- Auto-splits code (frontend/backend/docs) ⚡
- Suggests intelligent branches & fixes conflicts 🧠
- Cleans commits, auto-generates README 📄
- Pushes beautifully to GitHub, deploys in one click 🚀

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow

1. **Upload Project**: Drop your project folder/zip
2. **AI Analysis**: Platform auto-splits folders, suggests branches, checks for missed docs/tests
3. **GitHub Connect**: Login and link your repo
4. **Auto-Organize**: Creates branches, commits, resolves minor issues
5. **Status Dashboard**: See real-time push & error logs
6. **One-Click Deploy**: Instantly deploy to cloud (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
7. **Rollback/Safe Restore**: Undo or retry easily if something goes wrong
